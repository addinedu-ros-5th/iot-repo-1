## Improvements

1. Security Issues:
- Privacy Compliance: Ensure that camera installations are designed in compliance with privacy regulations and ethical considerations.
- Master Key Management: Implement a robust system for managing master keys, including encryption, key rotation, and access control policies.
2. Choosing an Appropriate Topic:
- Cost-Benefit Analysis: Conduct a thorough cost-benefit analysis to assess the feasibility and potential impact of the selected topic.
3. Analysis of Various Scenarios:
- Consider a variety of scenarios, including multiple risk scenarios, during the analysis process.
